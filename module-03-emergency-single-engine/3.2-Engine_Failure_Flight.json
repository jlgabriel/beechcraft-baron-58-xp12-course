        "Vmc introduction: 'Vmc = Minimum Control Speed single-engine. For Baron: Vmc equals 84 KNOTS. This is MOST CRITICAL speed in twin-engine flying. Below 84 knots with one engine failed: full rudder CANNOT maintain directional control, aircraft rolls uncontrollably toward dead engine, can enter spin, FATAL if near ground. You must NEVER let airspeed drop below Vmc with engine out. This is life-or-death critical. We will emphasize this throughout entire challenge'",
        "Why Vmc exists: 'Physics of asymmetric flight: Operating engine produces thrust far from centerline, creates massive yawing moment, rudder provides counter-force to maintain control. Rudder effectiveness depends on airspeed - faster speed more rudder authority. At high speeds: sufficient rudder authority. As speed decreases: rudder authority decreases. At Vmc (84 knots): full rudder deflection BARELY sufficient. Below Vmc: full rudder INSUFFICIENT - loss of control occurs. This is not pilot skill issue - this is aerodynamic limitation'",
        "Vmc consequences: 'What happens below Vmc with engine out: Aircraft yaws uncontrollably toward dead engine, wing drops on dead engine side, can enter spin rapidly, pilot cannot recover with full control deflection, crash is likely outcome. Near ground: absolutely fatal. This is why Vmc is painted as BLUE LINE on airspeed indicator. Stay above blue line with engine out or die. Not exaggeration - aerodynamic reality'",
        "Vyse - blue line: 'Vyse = 105 knots = Best Rate of Climb Single-Engine. Also called BLUE LINE. This is target speed for single-engine operations. Provides: safe margin above Vmc (21 knots above minimum), best climb performance available, good control authority. When engine fails: establish Vyse immediately. This is your lifeline speed'",
        "Immediate actions: 'Engine failure in flight requires immediate actions - MIVF acronym: MAINTAIN airspeed above Vmc and directional control, IDENTIFY failed engine (dead foot dead engine), VERIFY identification correct before securing, FEATHER failed engine propeller. These actions must be automatic - no thinking required. We train muscle memory today'",
        "Single-engine performance: 'Baron single-engine performance realistic expectations: Service ceiling drops from 20,688 feet to approximately 7,000 feet. Climb rate: 200-300 FPM at sea level light weight. At gross weight or high density altitude: may NOT climb at all. Single-engine flight maintains altitude in most conditions but climb capability very limited. Must plan accordingly'",
