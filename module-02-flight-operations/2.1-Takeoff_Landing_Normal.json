Focus on consistency and smoothness.\n\n**COVERAGE:** Multiple normal takeoffs, left traffic patterns, right traffic patterns, landing technique refinement, go-around procedures, building consistency through repetition.\n\n**EXPECTATIONS:** Student should execute procedures more independently. Look for: proper power management sequences, appropriate speeds maintained, smooth control inputs, good pattern discipline, improving consistency.
