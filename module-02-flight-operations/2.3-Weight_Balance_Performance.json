Cannot guess or estimate - must calculate precisely'",

CG too far aft - tail heavy, unstable, possible loss of control in flight, stall characteristics poor. Overweight - longer takeoff roll, reduced climb performance, longer landing distance, structural stress, illegal operation. These are not theoretical - real accidents happen from W&B errors'",

        "Density altitude: 'Density altitude - critical concept affecting Baron performance dramatically. Combination of pressure altitude and temperature'",
        "What is density altitude: 'Density altitude: altitude at which aircraft performs given air density. High temperature or high altitude = high density altitude = thin air. Thin air means: less lift from wings, less engine power produced, less propeller thrust, worse performance all around. Baron performance significantly degraded high density altitude'",
        "Calculating density altitude: 'Calculate density altitude: start with pressure altitude (altimeter set 29.92), correct for temperature deviation from standard, result is density altitude. Hot day high altitude = very high density altitude. Example: KSFO sea level on 90°F day has density altitude approximately 2000-2500 feet - performs like at 2500 feet altitude'",
        "Performance effects: 'High density altitude effects on Baron: much longer takeoff roll - can be double at high DA, significantly reduced climb rate - can be half of sea level rate, longer landing distance, reduced service ceiling, engine produces less power, propeller less efficient. Critical for safety at high altitude or hot weather airports'",
        "Example - hot day: 'Example scenario: Baron at 5200 lbs, airport elevation 5000 feet, temperature 90°F. Density altitude approximately 8500 feet! Baron performance: takeoff roll approximately 2800 feet vs 1400 at sea level, climb rate approximately 900 FPM vs 1700 FPM, service ceiling reduced to approximately 16,000 feet vs 20,000. Dramatic differences!'",
        "Weight interaction: 'Weight and density altitude compound: heavy Baron at high DA = worst performance, light Baron at high DA = better but still degraded, always reduce weight when operating high DA if possible, fuel vs performance tradeoff critical. Example: full fuel heavy Baron at high DA airport might not clear obstacles on departure. Reduce fuel = lighter = better performance = safer'",
        "POH corrections: 'Baron POH performance charts include: temperature corrections for takeoff and landing distances, pressure altitude effects, combined give density altitude performance, use these charts for any high altitude or hot weather operations. Required for safe planning'",
        "Mountain flying: 'Mountain flying considerations: airports often high elevation - permanent high DA, hot summer days make worse, terrain obstacles require good climb, weight reduction essential, fuel stops more frequent, conservative planning required. Baron capable but must respect limitations'",
        "Hot weather operations: 'Hot weather at any altitude: even sea level very hot day creates high DA, summer operations require: lighter loading, longer runways, early morning departures when cooler, conservative planning, awareness of degraded performance'",
        "Professional approach: 'Professional pilots: always calculate density altitude for flight, use POH charts for performance prediction, plan conservative margins at high DA, reduce weight when possible, choose departure times wisely, never assume Baron will perform like sea level standard day unless it is. Density altitude kills - respect it'",
        "Safety: 'Density altitude accidents common in general aviation: pilots underestimate effects, load too heavy for conditions, insufficient runway, inadequate climb, impact terrain or obstacles. Prevent by: calculating DA, using POH, reducing weight, ensuring adequate margins. Your weight and balance planning must include DA considerations'",
