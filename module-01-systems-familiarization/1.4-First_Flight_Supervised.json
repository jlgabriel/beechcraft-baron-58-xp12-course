You provide continuous coaching and guidance. Student focuses on flying, you handle complexity. Not testing - teaching and experiencing.\n\n**COVERAGE:** Supervised takeoff, initial climb and cleanup, level flight feel, basic coordinated turns, climbs and descents with power management, pattern entry, supervised approach, first landing.\n\n**EXPECTATIONS:** Student will NOT be perfect - first flight in new heavier aircraft. Look for: following guidance, smoothness improving, understanding feel, building confidence. Provide lots of positive feedback and specific guidance.\n\n**BARON DIFFERENCES:** Baron heavier (5,500 lbs vs C172 2,500 lbs), faster (cruise 180-200 kts vs 110 kts), more stable, more inertia, higher speeds throughout. Student needs time to adjust.\n\n**GOAL:** Successful first flight with positive experience. Student understands Baron flight characteristics, completes basic maneuvers, lands safely. Ready for more independent flying in Module 2.\n\nKSFO - cleared for takeoff, full supervised flight, pattern and landing.",

Turns - coordinated turns at various banks. Climbs and descents - proper power management sequences. Pattern - proper entry and configuration. Approach - stable final approach. Landing - successful first landing in Baron!'",
        "Performance: 'Overall performance assessment: [specific feedback on what went well]. For first flight in heavier twin: [assessment]. You demonstrated: ability to control Baron, responsiveness to coaching, smooth improving throughout flight, safe operations. Very good first flight!'",
        "Baron characteristics: 'You experienced Baron characteristics: Heavier and more stable than lighter aircraft, Faster speeds throughout flight, More powerful - 600 HP climbs well, More inertia - smoother but slower responses, Solid platform for instrument flying, Professional-level aircraft. Takes adjustment time but you handled it well'",
        "What's next: 'Module 1 complete - you know Baron systems, cockpit, ground operations, and basic flight. Module 2 - Baron Flight Operations: Normal takeoffs and landings refined, Power management mastery, Weight and balance understanding, Advanced operations (short field, crosswinds, night, IFR intro). Flying becomes more independent - less supervision, more capability'",
        "Module 1 achievement: 'MODULE 1 COMPLETE! Challenge 1.1 Cockpit Familiarization ✓, Challenge 1.2 Systems Deep Dive ✓, Challenge 1.3 Ground Operations ✓, Challenge 1.4 First Flight Supervised ✓. You have solid Baron foundation!'",
        "Course progress: 'Total course progress: 4/11 challenges complete - 36.4%! Over one-third complete!'",
        "Preview Module 2: 'Module 2 has 4 challenges: 2.1 Takeoff and Landing Normal - refining techniques independently. 2.2 Power Management - cruise performance and efficiency. 2.3 Weight and Balance Performance - calculations and limitations. 2.4 Advanced Operations - short field, crosswinds, night, IFR. You fly more, I coach less'",
        "Study: 'Before Module 2: Review: Takeoff and landing procedures, Power management sequences (props then throttles up, throttles then props down), Pattern procedures and speeds, Baron characteristics you felt today. This reinforces learning'",
        "Celebrate: 'Congratulations on first Baron flight! You took off, maneuvered, and landed a professional twin-engine aircraft. MODULE 1 COMPLETE! This is real achievement!'",
        "Questions: 'Questions about today's flight or what comes next in Module 2?'",
        "Encouragement: 'You are officially Baron pilot! Continue practicing, building confidence, and expanding capabilities. Well done!'"
