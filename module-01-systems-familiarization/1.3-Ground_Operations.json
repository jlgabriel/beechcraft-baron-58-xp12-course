Run-up - complete checks both engines including mags, props, systems. Before takeoff - final configuration and takeoff briefing'",
        "Professional procedures: 'You followed systematic procedures from Baron POH. This is how professional pilots operate: methodical, thorough, checklist-based. Not rushing, not skipping, not guessing. These habits prevent accidents'",
        "Twin-engine considerations: 'You learned twin-engine specific procedures: Two engines to start and check, Two sets of mags to check, Two props to cycle, Monitoring both engines constantly, Differential thrust for ground maneuvering, Higher weight affecting taxi and turning. Baron requires attention to both engines always'",
        "Key points: 'Remember critical items: Oil pressure within 30 seconds of start or shut down. Mag check drops 50-150 RPM acceptable. Prop cycles smoothly verifies governor. Cowl flaps open for ground and takeoff. Fuel boost pumps ON for takeoff. Before takeoff briefing includes engine failure plan'",
        "Next challenge: 'Challenge 1.4 - First Flight Supervised. We fly the Baron! I will handle some complexity initially while you get feel for aircraft. Basic maneuvers, pattern work, landing. Your first Baron flight!'",
        "Module 1 progress: 'Module 1 - Systems and Familiarization: Challenge 1.1 Cockpit Familiarization ✓, Challenge 1.2 Systems Deep Dive ✓, Challenge 1.3 Ground Operations ✓, Challenge 1.4 First Flight Supervised (next - THE FLIGHT!)'",
        "Course progress: 'Total course progress: 3/11 challenges complete - 27.3%'",
        "Celebrate: 'Excellent work! You prepared Baron professionally from cold aircraft to ready for flight. Ground operations are foundation for safe flying - you did it right!'",
        "Preview: 'Next session: First Flight! We will: takeoff together, feel Baron flight characteristics, practice basic maneuvers (climbs, descents, turns), fly traffic pattern, land. I guide you through complexity - you focus on flying. Exciting!'",
        "Preparation: 'Before first flight: review: Takeoff speeds (Vr 85 knots, Vy 105 knots), Power settings (takeoff full power, cruise 23-25 inches MP / 2300-2500 RPM), Landing speeds (approach 90-95 knots final, Vref 80 knots threshold), Baron flies differently than lighter aircraft - heavier, faster, more stable. Be ready to feel professional aircraft!'",
        "Ask: 'Questions about ground operations or preparing for first flight?'",
        "Encourage: 'You have learned Baron inside and out: cockpit layout, systems operation, ground procedures. Now comes reward - flying this amazing aircraft!'"
